Usage: ./install.sh [OPTIONS]

Build and install gopacket tools. Run with no flags to get an interactive
prompt explaining the build targets.

Options:
  --target NAME   Build target. One of:
                    native    (default) Linux/macOS cgo, installs to
                              /usr/local/bin. All 63 tools; proxychains
                              and -proxy both work. Needs GCC + libpcap-dev.
                    portable  Static host-OS binaries, no system libs.
                              sniff/split stubbed; use -proxy (proxychains
                              won't hook). Output: ./dist/portable/
                    windows   Windows amd64 cross-compile. sniff/split/
                              sniffer stubbed; -proxy only (no LD_PRELOAD
                              on Windows). Output: ./dist/windows/
                    all       Build every target.

  --prefix DIR    For the native target, install to DIR instead of
                  /usr/local/bin. Has no effect on cross-compile targets.
  --build-only    Build but don't install (native target only).
  --uninstall     Remove previously installed gopacket-* binaries from
                  $INSTALL_DIR. Affects native installs only.
  -h, --help      Show this help.

Environment:
  INSTALL_DIR     Same as --prefix.

Examples:
  ./install.sh                          Interactive, prompts for target
  ./install.sh --target native          Today's default (build + install)
  ./install.sh --target windows         Cross-compile Windows .exe files
  ./install.sh --target all             Build every target in one run

Pick a build target. If unsure, pick (1).

  (1) native
      Linux/macOS cgo, installs to /usr/local/bin. All 63 tools; supports
      both proxychains (LD_PRELOAD) and the -proxy SOCKS5 flag.
      Needs GCC + libpcap-dev installed.

  (2) portable
      Static single-file binaries for your host OS, no system libs needed.
      sniff/split are stubs (they need libpcap). proxychains can't hook a
      cgo-off Go binary, so use -proxy instead. Output: ./dist/portable/

  (3) windows
      Windows amd64 .exe cross-compile. sniff/split/sniffer are stubs.
      No LD_PRELOAD on Windows, so -proxy is the only proxy path.
      Output: ./dist/windows/

  (4) all
      Build every target.
