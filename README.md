# gopacket

A complete Go implementation of [Impacket](https://github.com/fortra/impacket) - 63 tools and 24 library packages for Windows network protocol interaction, Active Directory enumeration, and attack execution. Built as a native Go framework so you can compile once and run anywhere without Python dependencies.

> **Beta Release - Highly Experimental.** gopacket is under active development. Core tools have been tested against Active Directory lab environments, but edge cases and protocol quirks are expected. If something isn't working, please test the same operation with Impacket side-by-side and include both outputs in your bug report. This helps us quickly identify whether it's a gopacket-specific issue or a shared protocol limitation.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mandiant/gopacket
cd gopacket

# Build and install all tools as gopacket-<toolname> on your PATH
./install.sh

# Or just build without installing
./install.sh --build-only

# Or build with make
make build
```

Requires Go 1.24.13+, GCC, and libpcap development headers
(install with `apt install build-essential libpcap-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu/Kali,
or `yum install gcc libpcap-devel` on RHEL/CentOS, or `brew install libpcap` on macOS).

The libpcap headers are only needed by the `sniff` and `split` tools - if
libpcap is missing, `install.sh` will skip those two and build the rest.

To uninstall:
```bash
./install.sh --uninstall
```

## Proxychains Support

All gopacket tools work through proxychains. Go binaries normally bypass proxychains because Go's runtime handles DNS and networking internally, skipping the `LD_PRELOAD` hooks that proxychains relies on. gopacket works around this by linking against the system C library for network operations, allowing proxychains to intercept connections normally.

```bash
proxychains gopacket-secretsdump 'domain/user:password@target'
proxychains gopacket-smbclient -k -no-pass 'domain/user@dc.domain.local'
```

## Missing Features (vs Impacket)

gopacket aims for full Impacket parity. The following are not yet implemented:

**Relay protocol clients:**
- IMAP relay client + attack (requires Exchange/IMAP server)
- SMTP relay client (requires SMTP server)

**Relay attack modules:**
- SCCM policies/DP attacks (requires SCCM infrastructure)

**Standalone tools:**
- `ifmap.py` (DCOM interface mapping)
- `mimikatz.py` (limited Mimikatz over RPC)
- `goldenPac.py` (MS14-068 - obsolete on patched systems)
- `smbrelayx.py` (superseded by ntlmrelayx)
- `kintercept.py` (Kerberos interception)

These gaps are low priority - most require niche infrastructure to test or are obsoleted by newer techniques.

## Known Limitations

These are protocol-level limitations shared with Impacket, not gopacket bugs:

- **SMB to LDAPS relay** fails on patched DCs due to NTLM MIC validation (post-CVE-2019-1040). Use HTTP coercion instead.
- **WinRM relay** blocked by EPA (Extended Protection for Authentication) on patched Server 2019+.
- **RPC relay attacks** (tschexec, enum-local-admins) require PKT_INTEGRITY which is unavailable in relay sessions.
- **LDAP relay to port 389** fails on DCs requiring LDAP signing. Always relay to LDAPS (port 636).

See [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for detailed information on each issue and workarounds.

## Reporting Issues & Contributing

> This is a beta release. Bugs are expected, and contributions are welcome.

### Why we ask you to test with Impacket first

Because gopacket implements the same wire protocols as Impacket, a large
fraction of "bugs" turn out to be **environmental**, not gopacket-specific -
patched DCs, LDAP signing requirements, EPA, PKT_INTEGRITY, SMB signing,
NTLM MIC validation post-CVE-2019-1040, missing SPNs, time skew, DNS quirks,
firewall rules, and so on. Running the same operation with Impacket side by
side removes the environment from the equation:

- **If Impacket fails the same way**, the issue is almost always
  environmental and is likely already documented in
  [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md). No bug report needed.
- **If Impacket succeeds where gopacket fails**, that's a real gopacket bug
  and exactly what we want to hear about.

This single triage step saves a lot of round-trips, so please don't skip it.

### Filing a bug report

1. Run the same operation with Impacket and note whether it succeeds or fails
2. Re-run gopacket with `-debug` and capture the full output
3. **Anonymize anything sensitive before posting.** GitHub issues are public.
   Strip or replace real hostnames, IP addresses, usernames, password hashes,
   Kerberos tickets, domain names, SIDs, and any output line that could be
   tied back to a real engagement. Replacing `corp.internal` → `example.local`
   and `dc01.corp.internal` → `dc01.example.local` is fine - keep the
   structure of the data, just not the identifying values. **If in doubt,
   redact it.**
4. Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mandiant/gopacket/issues/new) and include:
   - Both outputs (gopacket and Impacket), as text not screenshots, anonymized
   - The exact command line you ran (anonymized)
   - Target OS, AD functional level, and any relevant hardening
     (signing, EPA, channel binding, patch level)
   - gopacket version / commit hash

### Feature requests

Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mandiant/gopacket/issues/new) describing the use case
and the Impacket equivalent (if any). If the feature is on the
"Missing Features" list above, mention which one - it helps us prioritize.

### Pull requests

PRs are welcome. Before opening one:

- Run `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `gofmt -l .`, and `go test ./...`
  and make sure they all pass cleanly
- Match the existing code style in the package you're touching
- Keep changes focused - separate refactors from feature work
- For non-trivial changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach

## Why This Matters for Defenders

Threat actors are moving away from Python. Compiled Go and Rust tooling
(Sliver, BRC4, Geacon, and bespoke loaders) is increasingly replacing
Impacket in real-world intrusions. Most defensive tooling and detection
logic was built around Impacket's Python-based network behavior, and that
coverage is eroding as the attacker ecosystem shifts to compiled languages.

gopacket exists in part to help the security community get ahead of this
shift. By providing an open-source, readable Go implementation of the
same protocols and techniques, defenders and detection engineers can:

- **Study how Go-based tooling behaves on the wire** rather than waiting
  to encounter it during an incident
- **Understand the protocol-level differences** between Go and Python
  implementations that make existing signatures less effective
- **Run realistic purple team exercises** using the same compiled,
  single-binary tooling that threat actors are adopting, rather than
  testing exclusively against Python scripts that behave differently
  at the network layer

The gap between attacker tooling and defender visibility is widest when
new tooling stays private. Open-sourcing gopacket narrows that gap.

## Notes

- Kerberos authentication requires a valid ccache file (TGT or service ticket)
- For Kerberos, use the FQDN hostname - not an IP address
- If `KRB5CCNAME` is not set, tools will look for `<username>.ccache` in the current directory
- All tools work through proxychains
- This project is for authorized security testing and research purposes only
